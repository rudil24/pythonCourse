# pythonCourse - Rudi Lewis
## Project Description
This repo contains my work files (separated by day and/or project), as a student in [Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/), available on udemy. 
*Yes I used camelCase to name a python repo. Shows you how little python I knew when I started the class.* 😂 (JS guy here.)

## Deliverables
### MVP: Complete the 100 Days of Code with 
  * __good__ knowledge of the main components and structure of the python language
  * __great__ knowledge of when and how to use python's best/most well known / external libraries (especially for data i/o/manipulation and data analytics and visualization)
  * __intrinsic__ knowledge of how to assign and guide python projects to AI agent(s) using: 
    * **Google Code Assist (extension of vs code)**
      * supporting comments (roles and instructions) to Gemini 3.0 Pro as inline code comments and external markdown context files, in both prompt and agent mode.
### Stretch Goals: 
  * orchestrated AI completing tasks or entire projects autonomously, using command line interface and/or API from Google (Gemini) and/or Anthropic (Claude).

## Highlights
* [day021](./solutions/day021) **Snake game** A great experience in learning python Classes, inheritance, Objects, and pushing beyond limits to learn about file read/writes to make the game better (high scores).
* [day023](./solutions/day023) **Turtle Crossing Game** Where i really started using the individual project README.md's to drive code execution for myself, AND with Gemini Code Assist
* [day028](./solutions/day028) **Pomodoro Timer** I love pomodoro method so my interest was piqued and i really liked learning about how to control on-screen timers
* [day031](./solutions/day031) **Language Flash Cards** Most useful end-user output of all the projects so far! Enjoyed working through nested try/except blocks to ensure data read/writes 
* [day034](./solutions/day034) **Quizzler GUI Quiz App** I put some nice upgrades in here for real-time stats to the user, and making the pull of the random quizzes dead simple
* [day048](./solutions/day048) **Cookie Clicker Bot** Great practice with Selenium (much more powerful web scraper/clicker than BeautifulSoup), and very interesting optimization problems for stat hounds.
<!-- 
* [day0xx](./solutions/day0xx) **Project Name** comment
* [day022](./solutions/day022) **Pong game** was fun to reminisce playing this the first time around 👴🏼, also was my first invocation of Gemini for "grunt work" (refactor all my game tweaking variables across *.py into a constants.py file)
* [day053](./solutions/day053) **Zillow Alerts** this keystone project helped me put together all of my web scraping and clicking skills from BeautifulSoup and Selenium into a "rental search bot".

## To Run
1. Instructions in each README.MD of major project folders to user on how to run either from web (if available) or in their local environment


## Reflection
| DATE        | COMMENTS |
| ----------- | -------- |
| 23-jan-2026 | feeling stronger with the combo of writing strong req's in README.MD then pair programming with Google Code Assist in code completion AND left pane prompts of vs code. |
| 13-jan-2026 | SNAKE game and PONG game complete (days 21 and 22), now seeing the usefulness of python in simple pixel rendering / animation / gaming applications. I also like how the superclass / class inheritance works, excited about learning how to apply that more. |
| 09-jan-2026 | after doing the basics (first 14 days packed into 9 days), i can see how python scripts are very useful for math and quick logic applications. Skeptical on their application to web development but we'll get there in the class.                            |
