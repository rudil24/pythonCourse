# Gemini Code Assist will read this file for this project folder
# This forces Gemini to treat notebooks as "write-only" for new code (avoiding the "destory" error) while allowing it to fully index your .py and .js files for the best possible assistance.
# Ignore Jupyter Notebooks to prevent "can't destroy" errors
**/*.ipynb

# Ignore hidden notebook checkpoints
**/.ipynb_checkpoints/

# Keep indexing active for core logic files
