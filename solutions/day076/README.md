In this lesson we looked at how to:
  * Pull a random sample from a DataFrame using `.sample()`
  * How to find duplicate entries with `.duplicated()` and `.drop_duplicates()`
  * How to convert string and object data types into numbers with `.to_numeric()`
  * How to use **plotly** to generate beautiful pie, donut, and bar charts as well as box and scatter plots
  * __BONUS 1:__ how to use local data storage AND Github data storage to access the .csv's in the notebook see [today's notebook](./Google%20Play%20Store%20App%20Analytics%20(start).ipynb).
  * __BONUS 2:__ how to connect Google Colab to Github so that I can share notebook progress/editing in Colab and vs_code!!: 
    * open Colab, connect to GitHub to grab a notebook by the URL
    * work with the notebook in Colab, commit them back to Github, 
    * pull the edited notebook, work on it in vs_code, commit & push back to Github
    * lather, rinse, repeat.
