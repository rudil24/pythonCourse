### Rudi Lewis - my notes on Angela's Web Design Concepts

#### *Summary*

* Design is powerful, it is one of the cheapest ways to make your company or your product look expensive  
* There are 4 Web Design Pillars: Color theory, Typography, User Interface Design, and User Experience Design  
* Color, font, and layout have huge subliminal effects\!  
* Practice good design via tasks at [Daily UI](https://www.dailyui.co/) AND see what others have contributed  
* Tool: [Canva.com](http://Canva.com) for free-to-use online graphic design tool

#### *Keywords / Questions*

* Where can i get her poster of mood/tone of fonts  
* Is there more research on the subliminal / psyche of colors fonts and layout?

#### *Notes*

* Why Care?   
  * The beauty of your website is crucial to creating your brand and image as successful. You have a crucial few seconds before you get judged. Surveys show people are willing to pay up to 3x for a product from a well-designed website vs an amateur hour.  
  * In addition to  revenue, the right aesthetic adds quality, trust, and brand recognition  
* Pillar 1: Color Theory  
  * Moods  
    * Red: Love, Energy, Intensity (car ads)  
    * Yellow: Joy, Intellect, Attention (draws attention like a bikini, so don’t overuse it, it hurts eyes)  
    * Green: Freshness, Growth, Safety: (food ads)  
    * Blue: Stability, Trust, Serenity (trustworthy ads like financial)  
    * Purple: Royalty, Wealth, Femininity (Angela has seen "payday loans to women?")  
  * Combining colors \- scientific  
    * Analogous colors: next to each other on the color wheels  
    * Complementary colors: (clashing) creates a POP\!  
      * Red meat in a green divider  
      * But DON’T style text with complementaries \- it hurts  
    * Triadic: three colors 360/3 degrees away from each other on the wheel  
    * Square: three colors 360/4 degrees away from each other on the wheel  
    * See [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) for great interactive play with the above\!  
* Pillar 2: Typography  
  * Fonts matter\! (mood, combination)  
  * **Serif** family have little "feet" \- inspired by marble carvings in old times, with "non 90deg wedges" to get the tools out of the marble  
    * Serious, authoritative, "older"  
    * 4 types of serif: Old style, Transitional, Modern, Slab-Serif  
    * More difference between thickest and thinnest part tells us more modern.  
  * Moods  
    * Serif: Traditional, Stable, Respectable, Authorative  
    * Sans-Serif: Sensible, Simple, Straightforward \- very popular in body text  
      * Readability: "Humanist" types: (Gill Sans, Tahoma, Verdana)  
      * are more readable because of open shapes, ample intercharacter spacing, unambiguous forms, and varying proportions, than:  
      * "Grotesque" types (News Gothic)  
    * Script: Personal, Creative, Elegant  
    * Display: Friendly, Loud, Amusing  
    * Modern: Stylish, Chic, Smart  
  * Don’t Overuse: Angela recommends sticking to **2 total fonts** for any integrated designs (a poster, website, etc.)  
    * Find similar moods and similar time era, but it’s ok to change up between serif & sans-serif. Also use weights to increase contrast.  
* Pillar 3: User Interface Design  
  * Humans are drawn to the bigger bolder squarer things.  
  * 1 Hierarchy: pull the eye to the most important things  
    * Color: colors vs grays; whites vs grays  
    * Size: bigger items draw your attention  
  * 2 Layout: create interest with blocks of text interspersed with pics, callouts, etc.   
    * 80+ chars per line is a snoozefest. 30 whips your head. 40 to 60 chars per line is a happy medium  
  * 3 Alignment:  
    * Center title with center body / left aligned title with left aligned body  
    * Reduce the number of alignment points\! Start everything on same Left gridline.  
    * Looks more coherent  
  * 4 White Space:  
    * Try for more empty space around your elements (think luxury handbag shop vs filene's basement)  
    * ![][image1]  
  * 5 Audience  
    * Use fun for fun things; serious for serious things  
* Pillar 4: User Experience Design  
  * College kids will trample the best paths between bldgs  
  * Don’t try to force an aesthetic over human nature. Humans want it Easy and effortless\!  
  * 1 Simplicity \- don’t overwhelm with content or complex framework  
  * 2 Consistency \- keep the same thing throughout your site. Don’t be like directv or xfinity\! ESPECIALLY with older users\!  
  * 3 Reading Patterns  
    * F pattern: Top left, Left gutter are most important.  
    * Z pattern: Top left to top right, diag down to lower left, go right again (like Zorro\!)  
  * 4 All Platform Design \- make it mobile responsive and employ responsive design overall\!  
    * Don’t make desktop mode too "skinny", i’m not on my phone use the space of my monitor.  
    * Don’t persist too many warnings on mobile so the usable window is like an apple watch, but don’t but put big pics & big font and make me finger scroll 10 times for a paragraph.  
  * 5 Don’t use your powers for evil with Dark patterns: meant to get you to perform an action you don’t want.  
    * The button that makes the company more money is bolded/orange vs the one you already get for free is secondary.  
    * "Fake hair on the screen" makes you tap it which takes you where you don’t want to go.  
    * Ryan Air: "Don’t buy air insurance" is hidden in a long list   
    * Confusing worded clickboxes  
* Put it all together in a Canva.com 3-page mock-up  
  * Hero page: Title \+ subtitle with graphic, possibly textures, possibly colors.  
  * Features page (3 columns with 3 photos, 3 subheaders, 3 p’s, for example)  
  * Contact or call to action page: another fullpage  
  * Canva lets you publish as webpage (look through their "upload/share" options)
