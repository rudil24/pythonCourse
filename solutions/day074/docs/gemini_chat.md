any tips on when to use print vs display when showing pandas data in a notebook?

This is a great question that touches on the specific behavior of the IPython kernel (which powers Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab, and VS Code notebooks).

While both print() and display() output data, they interact with the notebook's rendering engine differently.

Here is a breakdown of when to use which, followed by code examples.

## Summary: The Rule of Thumb
Use display() (or simply output the variable at the end of a cell) for DataFrames and Series. It renders interactive, readable HTML tables.
Use print() for debugging strings, raw text, or logging, or when you specifically need the ASCII string representation of the data.
1. When to use display()
In a notebook environment, display() is almost always superior for Pandas objects.

Rich Formatting: display() utilizes the _repr_html_ method of the DataFrame. This renders a clean HTML table with borders, bold headers, and alternating row colors (depending on the theme). print() only outputs a monospaced ASCII string.
Multiple Outputs in One Cell: By default, a notebook cell only renders the result of the last line of code. If you want to show the head() of a dataframe and then the describe() summary in the same cell, you must wrap them in display().
Pandas Styling: If you use the Pandas Styler API (e.g., df.style.highlight_max()), print() will output a generic object string (e.g., <pandas.io.formats.style.Styler object>), whereas display() renders the actual styled table.
2. When to use print()
Copy-Pasting Text: If you need to copy the data as plain text to paste into a GitHub issue, a chat message, or a text file, print() provides the raw text format.
Console/Script Compatibility: If you plan to export your notebook to a standard Python script (.py) later, display() will fail unless you import it from IPython.display. print() works everywhere.
Performance (Rare): If you are printing a massive amount of text where HTML rendering might lag the browser, print() is slightly lighter weight, though Pandas usually truncates output automatically anyway.
Code Example
Here is a comparison showing how to use both, including the "Multiple Outputs" scenario which is the most common use case for explicit display() calls.

```python
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {
    'Product': ['Laptop', 'Mouse', 'Monitor'],
    'Price': [1200.50, 25.00, 300.99],
    'In_Stock': [True, True, False]
}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# --- SCENARIO 1: Visual Difference ---

# print() results in plain text (monospaced font)
print("--- Using print() ---")
print(df) 
print("\n")

# display() results in a rendered HTML table
print("--- Using display() ---")
display(df)


# --- SCENARIO 2: Multiple Outputs in One Cell ---

print("\n--- Multiple Outputs ---")
# If we didn't use display() here, only df.tail(1) would show up!
display(df.head(1))
display(df.tail(1))


# --- SCENARIO 3: Styling (Only works with display) ---

print("\n--- Styling ---")
# This highlights the maximum price in yellow
# If you used print() here, you would just see an object memory address
display(df.style.highlight_max(subset=['Price'], color='yellow'))
```
## Key Takeaway
If you are doing data analysis and want to see your data clearly, stick to display(). If you are writing a quick debugging statement or need raw text output, use print().

# Rudi Lewis
can you do a display(f similar to a print(f? or would that be another reason to use print in notebooks?

Yes, you can pass an f-string to display(), but the output will look different than print().

Because an f-string evaluates to a standard Python string before the function receives it, display() accepts it just fine. However, display() renders the object representation of that string (often including quotes), whereas print() renders the raw text (no quotes).

Here is the breakdown of why this matters and how to get the best of both worlds.

1. The Visual Difference
If you use display() on a string, Jupyter usually renders it as if you had typed the string at the end of a cell—meaning it keeps the single quotes around it.

python
 Show full code block 
```python
from IPython.display import display

name = "Pandas"
version = "2.0"

# print(f) -> Clean text, good for logs
# Output: Loaded Pandas version 2.0
print(f"Loaded {name} version {version}")

# display(f) -> Shows the string object (note the quotes)
# Output: 'Loaded Pandas version 2.0'
display(f"Loaded {name} version {version}")
Is this a reason to use print? Yes. If you are logging status updates (e.g., "Processing row 1...", "Done."), print() is cleaner because it doesn't clutter the output with quotes.

2. The "Pro" Way: Markdown with f-strings
If you want to use display() with text, you usually want it to look better than plain text (e.g., bolding variables or using headers).

You can combine display() with Markdown to render f-strings as rich HTML text. This is a superpower print() does not have.

python
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

rows = 1500
cols = 25

# This renders actual Bold text and proper formatting
display(Markdown(f"The dataset has **{rows}** rows and **{cols}** columns."))

# You can even use headers
display(Markdown(f"### Summary for Dataset: {name}"))
Summary Table
Method	Code	Output Style	Best For
Print	print(f"Val: {x}")	Val: 10	Logging, debugging, raw text copy-paste.
Display	display(f"Val: {x}")	'Val: 10'	Rarely used for strings directly (looks messy with quotes).
Markdown	display(Markdown(f"Val: {x}"))	Val: 10 (Rich Text)	Final reports, headers, polished notebook presentation.
