# Gym Site Automation - Rudi Lewis
Day 49 Project in the 100 days of Python!
## Project Description
Use all the tools we've learned PLUS new powerful automation skills to help automate some tasks at your local gym site, [Snack & Lift](https://appbrewery.github.io/gym/).
We'll learn:
  * Set up persistent browser profiles (so our site remembers who we are)
  * Handle dynamic content that changes based on the date & time
  * Deal with different button states for gym class registration (Available, Full, etc.)
  * Use function wrappers & higher order functions to implement retry logic (resiliency to network failures)
  * Quality Assurance by verifying our automated bookings went through

## Deliverables
### MVP: 
- [ ] Setup, Chrome Profile, and Basic Navigation
- [ ] Automated Login
- [ ] Book the upcoming Tuesday class
- [ ] Check if a class is already booked
- [ ] Add counters to provide a summary
- [ ] Book every Tuesday AND Thursday class
- [ ] Verify class bookings on the "My Bookings" page
- [ ] Quality Assurance (using built-in time travel capability of the site)
- [ ] Add resilience in case of network failures
- [x] utilize object oriented programming wherever possible (classes and methods in separate external files, use class inheritance, keep main.py very tight and readable for flow.)
- [x] employ great documentation in any and all *.py files, written so other developers and casuals can easily understand your code blocks and flow
### Stretch Goals:

### Super Stretch Goals:

## To Run
  1. For now, clone to local deployment only. 
     - Requires:
       - Selenium api package available on pypi.org
  2. I built it in Python 3.14.2, but I think it should work in any 3.x based on the standard libraries and code used.

## Development Workflow
- [ ] 1. 
- [ ] 1. Implement and Test
