# Solution & Learning Points

This was the most challenging data science project to date!

## Today I've learned

* How to quickly spot relationships in a dataset using Seaborn's .pairplot().
* How to split the data into a training and testing dataset to better evaluate a model's performance.
* How to run a multivariable regression.
* How to evaluate that regression-based on the sign of its coefficients.
* How to analyse and look for patterns in a model's residuals.
* How to improve a regression model using (a log) data transformation.
* How to specify your own values for various features and use your model to make a prediction.

For all the details, take a look at my [final](./Multivariable_Regression_and_Valuation_Model_(final).ipynb) notebook.
